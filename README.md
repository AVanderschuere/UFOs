### Overview of Project

The purpose of this project was to display UFO sightings for Dana. She has a file with information about sightings but needed a way to display this data and make it easier for a web user to filter the data to find the information that they are looking for.

### Results

To perform a search, the user will enter the filter criteria they are wanting to search by in the Filter Search options on the left hand side of the table. The example provided shows that the city El Cajon was entered in the City filter box. This resulted in showing only the sightings that were in El Cajon.
